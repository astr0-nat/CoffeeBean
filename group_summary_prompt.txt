I am sending a long message that is a collection of texts. each text is delimited with five dashes ( ex: ----- ).
 Each text represents the summary of a correspondence via email chain. this collection of texts represents
 all the separate email correspondances sent to a particular email group.

summarize the activity of the group given the thread summaries. if applicable, Highlight any conclusions or decisions made, and outline these
outcomes or resolutions. From the discussions, derive concrete and actionable tasks or goals, specifying the
required actions, their frequency, and any pertinent timeframes.
